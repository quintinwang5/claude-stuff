# LDS Optimization

Diagnose and fix LDS (shared memory) performance issues in Triton/Gluon kernels
on AMD CDNA GPUs (MI300X/MI308/MI350).

## When To Use

Run `/kernel-trace-analysis` first. Apply this skill when the trace shows:

| Signal | Threshold | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)` with high stall | > 3000 cycles per instance | `L605: stall=4080 s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)` |
| `ds_write` / `ds_read` with high latency | > 500 cycles per instance | `L761: stall=960 ds_write2_b32` |
| Multiple `s_barrier` between `ds_write` and `ds_read` | Barrier stall > 5000 | `L606: stall=17024 s_barrier` |
| Total LDS-related stall > 15% of kernel stall | Sum all lgkmcnt + ds stalls | Softmax reduce phase in PA decode |

## LDS Architecture on CDNA3 (gfx942)

### Hardware Facts

- LDS size: **64 KB per CU** (workgroup-shared)
- LDS is organized into **32 banks**, each **4 bytes wide**
- Bank index = `(byte_address / 4) % 32`
- **Bank conflict**: when 2+ threads in the same wavefront access **different addresses** in the **same bank** in the same cycle, accesses are serialized
- **Broadcast**: when 2+ threads access the **same address** in the same bank, hardware broadcasts (no conflict)
- LDS throughput: **128 bytes/cycle** (peak, no conflicts)
- LDS latency: **~20-40 cycles** (async, hidden if enough work between write and read)
- **VGPR context**: LDS ops use **arch_vgpr** (not accum_vgpr). On CDNA3, arch_vgpr and accum_vgpr are separate 256-entry register files. LDS optimization does not interact with MFMA accumulator register pressure. See `/kernel-trace-analysis` Section 5.5 for VGPR architecture details.

### LDS Instruction Model

LDS operations (`ds_read_*`, `ds_write_*`, `ds_bpermute_*`, `ds_swizzle_*`) are **asynchronous**:

```
ds_write_b32 v_addr, v_data    ; issues async write, returns immediately
; ... other instructions ...    ; LDS write completes in background
s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)            ; stall until all LDS/SMEM ops complete
ds_read_b32 v_result, v_addr   ; now safe to read
```

Key rules:
1. **Write-before-read requires sync**: any `ds_read` that depends on a prior `ds_write` must have `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)` or `s_barrier` in between
2. **`s_barrier` implies cross-wave sync**: if wave A writes and wave B reads, `s_barrier` is required (not just `lgkmcnt`)
3. **Longer write-read distance = better latency hiding**: more instructions between `ds_write` and the subsequent `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)` allow the write to complete in the background

## Diagnosing LDS Bottlenecks from Trace

### Step 1: Identify LDS-heavy regions

```python
import json

with open('ui_output_agent_XXX_dispatch_YYY/code.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
instructions = data['code']
# Columns: [ISA, _, LineNum, Source, Codeobj, Vaddr, Hit, Latency, Stall, Idle]

# Find all LDS-related instructions
lds_insts = [i for i in instructions if i[0].startswith('ds_') or
             ('lgkmcnt' in i[0] and i[8] > 0)]

total_lds_stall = sum(i[8] for i in lds_insts)
total_stall = sum(i[8] for i in instructions)
print(f"LDS stall: {total_lds_stall} / {total_stall} = {100*total_lds_stall/total_stall:.1f}%")

# Show hottest LDS instructions
for i in sorted(lds_insts, key=lambda x: x[8], reverse=True)[:15]:
    print(f"  L{i[2]:>4d}  stall={i[8]:>6d}  idle={i[9]:>6d}  {i[0][:55]}  | :{i[3].split(':')[-1]}")
```

### Step 2: Classify the bottleneck type

**Type A: Bank Conflicts** (high stall on `ds_read`/`ds_write` themselves)

```
L 766  stall=  160  ds_read2_b64 v[44:47], v28 offset1:8        ; <-- bank conflict
L 767  stall=  320  ds_read2_b64 v[36:39], v28 offset0:16 offset1:24  ; <-- bank conflict
```

Signs:
- `ds_read_*` / `ds_write_*` instructions with stall > 100 cycles per hit
- Multiple reads/writes with similar base address but different offsets that map to same banks
- `ds_read2_b64` / `ds_write2_b32` with offsets that are multiples of 32 (= same bank)

**Type B: Write-Read Latency Exposed** (high stall on `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)` after `ds_write`)

```
L 761  stall=  960  ds_write2_b32 v28, v41, v43 offset0:32 offset1:48
L 764  stall= 4560  s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)    ; <-- write latency fully exposed
L 765  stall= 1468  s_barrier
L 766  stall=  160  ds_read2_b64 v[44:47], v28 offset1:8
```

Signs:
- `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)` with > 2000 stall cycles immediately after `ds_write`
- Very few instructions between `ds_write` and `s_waitcnt`
- This means the write hasn't completed by the time we need to wait

**Type C: Cross-Wave Reduce Serialization** (high stall on `s_barrier` in reduce chains)

```
L 605  stall= 4080  s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)     ; wait for ds_bpermute
L 606  stall=17024  s_barrier                 ; cross-wave sync
L 607  stall=27220  s_waitcnt vmcnt(0)        ; also waiting for global loads
```

Signs:
- `ds_bpermute` → `lgkmcnt(0)` → `s_barrier` → `ds_write LDS` → `lgkmcnt(0)` → `s_barrier` → `ds_read LDS` pattern
- Multiple barriers (> 4) in a reduce region
- See `/optimize-pa-decode-gluon` for reduce-specific optimizations

## Optimization Method 1: Swizzle Layout

### The Problem

When multiple threads access LDS with a stride that is a multiple of 32 banks (128 bytes), every access hits the same bank:

```
Thread 0: addr = base + 0*128  → bank 0
Thread 1: addr = base + 1*128  → bank 0  ← CONFLICT with thread 0
Thread 2: addr = base + 2*128  → bank 0  ← CONFLICT
...
```

### The Solution: XOR-Based Swizzle

Swizzle XORs bits of the row index into the column index of the LDS address, distributing accesses across different banks:

```
swizzled_col = original_col XOR (row >> shift)
```

This ensures threads accessing the same column in different rows hit different banks.

### Gluon SwizzledSharedLayout

Gluon provides `gl.SwizzledSharedLayout` to define conflict-free LDS layouts:

```python
# SwizzledSharedLayout(vec, perPhase, maxPhase, order)
#
# Parameters:
#   vec       - number of contiguous elements per thread (vectorization width)
#   perPhase  - number of elements per swizzle phase
#   maxPhase  - number of phases in the swizzle pattern
#   order     - dimension order [inner, outer] for the layout
#
# The swizzle XORs (col // vec) with (row % maxPhase) to remap bank indices

layout = gl.SwizzledSharedLayout(
    vec=8,           # 8 elements contiguous (fp16: 8*2=16 bytes = 4 banks)
    perPhase=1,      # 1 group per phase
    maxPhase=16,     # 16 phases = covers all bank combinations
    order=[1, 0]     # col-major: dim1 is contiguous
)

shared_tensor = gl.allocate_shared_memory(
    shape=[BLOCK_M, BLOCK_K],
    dtype=tl.float16,
    layout=layout
)
```

### Choosing Swizzle Parameters

The goal is to make `vec * perPhase * element_size` span enough banks, and `maxPhase` cover enough rows:

| Data Type | Element Size | Recommended `vec` | Banks Covered per Vec |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| fp32      | 4 bytes     | 4                 | 4 banks (16 bytes)   |
| fp16/bf16 | 2 bytes     | 8                 | 4 banks (16 bytes)   |
| fp8       | 1 byte      | 16                | 4 banks (16 bytes)   |

For `maxPhase`: use `32 / (vec * element_size / 4)` to ensure full bank coverage. Example:
- fp16, vec=8: each vec = 16 bytes = 4 banks → `maxPhase = 32/4 = 8` (minimum)
- fp8, vec=16: each vec = 16 bytes = 4 banks → `maxPhase = 32/4 = 8`

Using `maxPhase=16` gives 2x coverage for safety.

### Example: Fix Bank Conflicts in KV Cache Load to LDS

Before (conflict-prone, linear layout):

```python
# Linear shared memory layout — threads in same warp hit same banks
shared_key = gl.allocate_shared_memory(
    shape=[KV_BLOCK_SIZE, HEAD_SIZE],
    dtype=tl.float16
)
# Store key tile: all threads write to column 0,1,2... → bank conflicts
gl.shared_store(shared_key, key_data)
```

After (swizzled, conflict-free):

```python
# Swizzled layout distributes accesses across banks
key_layout = gl.SwizzledSharedLayout(
    vec=8,           # fp16: 8 elements = 16 bytes
    perPhase=1,
    maxPhase=8,      # 8 phases covers 32 banks
    order=[1, 0]     # HEAD_SIZE dimension is contiguous
)

shared_key = gl.allocate_shared_memory(
    shape=[KV_BLOCK_SIZE, HEAD_SIZE],
    dtype=tl.float16,
    layout=key_layout
)
gl.shared_store(shared_key, key_data)  # now conflict-free
```

## Optimization Method 2: Padding

### The Problem

Same as swizzle — stride-aligned accesses cause bank conflicts. Padding adds extra unused elements to change the effective stride.

### The Solution

Add 1 element of padding per row to break the alignment:

```python
# Without padding: row stride = HEAD_SIZE (e.g., 128)
# Bank stride = 128 * 2 / 4 = 64 → 64 % 32 = 0 → ALL rows hit same bank column

# With padding: row stride = HEAD_SIZE + 1 (e.g., 129)
# Bank stride = 129 * 2 / 4 = 64.5 → fractional → conflicts eliminated
```

### Gluon Padding Implementation

```python
# Allocate with extra column for padding
PADDED_HEAD_SIZE = HEAD_SIZE + PADDING  # PADDING = 1 or a small number

shared_key = gl.allocate_shared_memory(
    shape=[KV_BLOCK_SIZE, PADDED_HEAD_SIZE],
    dtype=tl.float16
)

# Write key data to [KV_BLOCK_SIZE, HEAD_SIZE] slice (ignore padding column)
gl.shared_store(shared_key[:, :HEAD_SIZE], key_data)

# Read back from the same slice
key_from_lds = gl.shared_load(shared_key[:, :HEAD_SIZE])
```

### Padding Amount

The minimum padding to eliminate all bank conflicts:

```
padding_elements = 32 / (element_size_bytes)  # worst case
```

But usually 1-4 elements suffice. The cost is extra LDS usage:
- 1 element padding per row: `KV_BLOCK_SIZE * element_size` extra bytes
- Must ensure total LDS usage stays within 64 KB per CU

### Swizzle vs Padding Trade-offs

| Aspect | Swizzle | Padding |
|--------|---------|---------|
| LDS overhead | None (zero extra bytes) | Extra bytes per row |
| Complexity | Need correct `vec`/`maxPhase` params | Simple: just add 1 to dimension |
| Gluon support | `gl.SwizzledSharedLayout` | Manual shape adjustment |
| Address computation | XOR adds ~1 SALU instruction | Simple offset, no extra compute |
| Risk | Wrong params = silent bank conflicts | Exceeding 64KB LDS = kernel fail |
| Preferred when | LDS near capacity, need zero overhead | Simple cases, LDS has headroom |

**Recommendation**: Prefer swizzle (zero overhead). Use padding only when swizzle layout is hard to integrate with the kernel's access pattern.

## Optimization Method 3: Increase Write-Read Distance

### The Problem

When `ds_write` is immediately followed by `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)` and then `ds_read`, the ~20-40 cycle LDS write latency is fully exposed as stall:

```
ds_write_b32 ...          ; async write issued
s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)      ; STALL: write hasn't completed yet (3000+ cycles)
ds_read_b32 ...           ; read must wait for write
```

### The Solution

Insert useful compute work between the write and the wait:

```
ds_write_b32 ...          ; async write issued
; --- insert independent compute here ---
v_mfma_f32_16x16x32 ...  ; MFMA takes ~64 cycles, overlaps with LDS write
v_add_f32 ...             ; more independent ALU work
v_mul_f32 ...
; --- write has completed by now ---
s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)      ; no stall (or minimal stall)
ds_read_b32 ...           ; data ready immediately
```

### Gluon-Level Implementation

At the Python/Gluon level, you control write-read distance by reordering operations:

```python
# BEFORE: write and read are close together
gl.shared_store(shared_buf, data)        # ds_write
tl.debug_barrier()                        # s_barrier (includes lgkmcnt wait)
result = gl.shared_load(shared_buf)       # ds_read

# AFTER: insert independent work between write and barrier
gl.shared_store(shared_buf, data)        # ds_write (async)

# Do independent compute that doesn't need shared_buf
next_offsets = compute_next_offsets()     # SALU/VALU work
next_data = gl.load(global_ptr + next_offsets)  # global load (also async)
scale_factor = gl.load(scale_ptr)        # another independent load

tl.debug_barrier()                        # by now, LDS write has completed
result = gl.shared_load(shared_buf)       # ds_read (no stall)
```

### What to Insert Between Write and Read

Prioritize by latency-hiding value:

1. **Global loads for next phase** (`gl.load`) — these are also async, ~300+ cycle latency
2. **Address computation** (`compute_offsets`) — SALU/VALU, ~4-8 cycles each
3. **Independent MFMA chains** — if available, ~64 cycles per MFMA
4. **Scalar loads** (`s_load_dword*`) — kernel arguments, ~20 cycles

Avoid inserting:
- Operations that depend on the LDS write result (data dependency)
- More LDS operations (would compete for LDS bandwidth)
- Operations that increase register pressure beyond budget

## Verification Checklist

After applying LDS optimizations:

1. **Correctness**: Run tests. Swizzle changes must be applied consistently to both write and read paths — if the write uses swizzled addresses, the read must use the same swizzle.

2. **Re-profile**: Run `/kernel-trace-analysis` and check:
   - `ds_read_*` / `ds_write_*` stall should decrease
   - `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt(0)` stall after `ds_write` should decrease
   - No new bank conflicts introduced

3. **LDS usage**: Check total LDS consumption:
   ```python
   # Estimate: sum of all gl.allocate_shared_memory shapes * element_size
   # Must be <= 65536 bytes (64 KB) per workgroup
   ```

4. **Register pressure**: Swizzle adds ~1-2 SALU instructions for address XOR. Padding doesn't add register pressure but uses more LDS. Neither should significantly impact VGPR count.

## Quick Reference: Common LDS Patterns in Paged Attention

| Pattern | Location | Typical Issue | Fix |
|---------|----------|---------------|-----|
| K/V cache tile in LDS | QK/PV MFMA loop | Bank conflicts from stride=HEAD_SIZE | Swizzle layout with vec=8 (fp16) or vec=16 (fp8) |
| Softmax reduce via LDS | `ds_write → barrier → ds_read` | Write-read latency exposed + too many barriers | Increase write-read distance; replace with `ds_bpermute` chain |
| Cross-wave max/sum broadcast | `ds_write → barrier → ds_read` from different wave | Cross-wave sync overhead | Merge max+sum into single reduce pass |
| MFMA accumulator shuffle | `ds_write accum → barrier → ds_read permuted` | Bank conflicts if accumulator layout misaligns | Swizzle or use `ds_bpermute` for permutation |

## Output

After optimization, report:
- Which LDS bottleneck type was identified (bank conflict / write-read latency / reduce serialization)
- Which optimization was applied (swizzle / padding / distance increase)
- Before/after `lgkmcnt` stall cycles and `ds_*` instruction stalls
- LDS usage before/after (bytes)
- Any impact on VGPR count or occupancy
